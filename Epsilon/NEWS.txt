    instead.
  - Use Twisted's deferLater implementation.
  - Add a service for communicating via stdio.

    of the returned string.

0.5.12 (2008-12-09):
  - Added support for AMP authentication via one-time pads.

0.5.11 (2008-10-02):
  - epsilon.amprouter added, providing support for multiplexing
    unrelated AMP communications over the same connection.

0.5.10 (2008-08-12):

    wrappers.
  - Better repr() for epsilon.structlike.record added.
  - epsilon.juice now uses twisted.internet.ssl instead of epsilon.sslverify.

0.5.9 (2008-01-18):

0.5.8 (2007-11-27):
  - extime.Time.asHumanly() no longer shows a time of day for all-day timestamps.

0.5.7 (2007-04-27):
  - view.SlicedView added, allowing slicing and indexing of large
    sequences without copying.

0.5.6 (2006-11-20):
  - Added a --quiet option to Epsilon's certcreate and use it in a few unit
    tests to avoid spewing garbage during test runs.

0.5.5 (2006-10-21):
  - extime.Time now accepts RFC2822-like dates with invalid fields: it
    rounds them to the nearest valid value.

0.5.4 (2006-10-17):
  - extime.Time now accepts RFC2822-like dates with no timezone.

0.5.3 (2006-09-20):
  - structlike.Record now raises TypeError on unexpected args.

0.5.2 (2006-09-12):
  - extime.Time now avoids time_t overflow bugs.

0.5.1 (2006-06-22):
  - Added hotfix for twisted.test.proto_helpers.StringTransport.

0.5.0 (2006-06-12):
  - Replaced '%y' with '%Y' in Time.asHumanly() output - the year is now
    four digits, rather than two.
  - Added new 'epsilon.structlike' functionality for simple record.
  - All uses of defer.wait and deferredResult were removed from the tests.
  - Added epsilon.juice, an asynchronous messaging protocol slated for
    inclusion in Twisted.  Improved a few features, such as the repr() of
    JuiceBox instances.  This was moved from Vertex.
  - Added epsilon.sslverify, a set of utilities for dealing with PyOpenSSL
    using simple high-level objects, performing operations such as signing and
    verifying certificates.  This was also moved from Vertex, and slated for
    inclusion in Twisted.
  - Added epsilon.spewer, a prettier version of the spewer in
    twisted.python.util.
  - Added "benchmark" tool for measuring and reporting run-times of python
    programs.

0.4.0 (2005-12-20):
  - Disabled crazy sys.modules hackery in test_setuphelper
  - Added module for creating a directory structure from a string template
  - Added support for 'now' to Time.fromHumanly()
  - Added a structured "hotfix" system to abstract and formalize monkey
    patches and version testing logic away from code which requires it.

0.3.2 (2005-11-05):
  - Added automatic support for Twisted plugins to autosetup

0.3.1 (2005-11-02):
  - Removed bogus dependency on Axiom.

0.3.0 (2005-11-02):

  - Added autosetup, a utility to actually include files in distutils releases,
    to epsilon.setuphelper

0.2.1 (2005-10-25):
  - Added 'short()' to epsilon.versions.Version
  - fixed setup.py to use epsilon.version.short() rather than static string.

0.2.0 (2005-10-25):
  - Added epsilon.modal.ModalType, metaclass for writing classes that
    behave in some respects like state machines
