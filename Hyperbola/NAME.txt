Hyperbola is so named because a "Hyperbola"
    (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hyperbola.html)
is a graceful curving shape, and the very similar-looking "Hyperbole"
   (http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&Database=*&Query=hyperbole)
is a very big exaggeration, something that people are prone to do on blogs and
forums.

Divmod Hyperbola is both a blog, and a forum.  It is designed to allow you to
gracefully express your shameless self-aggrandizement on the internet.
