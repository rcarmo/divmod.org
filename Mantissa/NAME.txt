In computer science, mantissa is the component of a floating-point number that
denotes the value of the number witout its order of magnitude.

Divmod Mantissa is an application server.  It is named for the floating-point
mantissa because it is the container for the "value" portion of an application.
This is explicitly linked to Divmod's other, proprietary project that has
parity with Mantissa, called "Exponent", which provides increased power for
Mantissa applications, by providing facilities for scaling and failover.

(The X on the package name is a temporary artifact of code migration, and will
be removed soon.)
