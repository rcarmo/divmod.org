Divmod Mantissa
===============

Divmod Mantissa is an application server with a web interface built using Axiom
and Nevow.

The goal of Mantissa is to provide a common platform that open-source
contributors can use to help us build customized additions to the Divmod
service. Divmod is going to offer a variety of different services (starting
with ClickChronicle and Quotient), and if you want to write something that
hooks into our network, Mantissa is how you do it.

It provides mechanisms for allowing users to sign up for accounts,
administrative tools, a web server, and a system for different plugins which
provide facets of functionality to advertise themselves to the administrator,
install themselves on the site database, and be installed and removed from
users' accounts.
