nevow (0.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. (Closes: #336027)
  * Acknowledge NMU (Closes: #319230), but please be more careful in the
    future; no NMU patch was sent to BTS
  * Remove setupcommon.pyc when cleaning, or dpkg-source will see a binary
    file content change.
  * Run unit tests when building.
  * Clean build tree, distutils fails to remove all of it.
  * Change priority to extra, as twisted is extra and nevow depends on it.

    is considered source code.
