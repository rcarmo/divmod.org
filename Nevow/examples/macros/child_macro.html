    Again, as you see this page has run the macro
    for this page. If you try to refresh you will see that the counter
    won't increase. That's because the macro is called only once, but
    different pages don't share the same expanded macro when you use
    xhtml templates with xmlfile. Currently loaders.stan,
    loaders.htmlfile, loaders.htmlstr, loaders.xmlstr do not allow
    this 'macro sharing' functionality because of the way they handle
    template cache. This will be fixed in the future.
