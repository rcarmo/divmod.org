Divmod Sine
===========

Divmod Sine is a standards-based voice-over-IP application server, built as an
offering for the Mantissa application server platform.

It owes much of its development to the excellent Shtoom soft-phone-in-Python
project, originally by Anthony Baxter.

It is still in the early stages of development and has not been tested
extensively.  Please feel free to help out!

Sine provides:

    - a SIP Registrar
    - a SIP Proxy
    - Third Party call control (3PCC)
    - Voice-mail
    - Through-the-web configuration
