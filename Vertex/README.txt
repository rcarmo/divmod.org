Divmod Vertex
=============

Divmod Vertex is the first implementation of the Q2Q protocol, which is a
peer-to-peer communication protocol for establishing stream-based communication
between named endpoints.

It is also a P2P application client and server platform in the early stages of
development.  It is currently quite usable for knocking holes in firewalls, but
requires some polish to really be usable.
