TCP-alike over UDP

Packet Format
=============

Connection ID - 32 bits
Sequence Number - 32 bits
Ack number - 32 bits
Window - 32 bits
Flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, IGN) - 8 bits
Checksum - 32 bits
Data length in bytes - 16 bits
Data - See previous

SEMANTICS
=========
Different types of packets:

just SYN:
SYN+ACK:
just ACK: normal tcp packet meanings

SYN+NAT: Request for information about the sender's public address

ACK+NAT: Response with information about the recipient's public address.  The
data is the IP address and port number to which the packet is being sent,
formatted as a dotted-quad formatted IP address followed by a colon followed by
the base-10 string representation of the port number..

STB: Size Too Big - a packet with a dlen greater than the length of its data
was received.

Other Stuff:

Connection IDs uniquely identify a stream for a protocol.  All bytes
associated with a particular connectionID will be delivered to the
same protocol instance.

Sequence Numbers indicate the senders notion of how far into its
outgoing stream this packet is.  Sequence numbers start from a
pseudo-random value within the allowed range and are incremented by
the number of bytes in each packet transmitted (re-transmits
discounted).  This indicates to the peer where the bytes in each
packet lie in the stream, allowing ordered delivery.

Ack numbers indicate the senders notion of how far into its incoming
stream all data has been received.  This value is always what the
sender expects the receiver to use as its next sequence number.

Window indicates the number of bytes in advance of the senders ack
number the receiver may proceed in sending.  This receiver's sequence
numbers must never be greater than the sender's last ack number plus
their window number.

Checksum is a CRC 32 of the data (and only the data - wait maybe this
should be the header less the checksum, too, in case things get
corrupted there)
